# How to edit the HUD code

## Prerequisites for local development

If you are on Windows, you will need WSL2 installed:
1. Install WSL2 with Ubuntu (v20 is fine): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
1. Install VSCode with the Remote Development Pack: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl
1. Close and reopen your WSL window if you have one open

Everything from here after assumes you are running in the Linux environment
1. Update your package list: `sudo apt update`
1. Install lua: `sudo apt install lua5.3`
1. Install NPM (Node.js): `sudo apt install npm`
1. Create an SSH key for GitHub: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your email>" -f ~/.ssh/<your_name>_rsa`
1. Update your SSH config file to use the key when talking to GitHub:
    ```
    cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF
    Host github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<your_name>_rsa
    EOF
    ```
1. Add the SSH Key to GitHub (see https://devconnected.com/how-to-setup-ssh-keys-on-github/#Add_SSH_key_to_your_GitHub_Account if you don't know how to do this)
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Dimencia/DU-Orbital-Hud.git`
1. `cd DU-Orbital-Hud`
1. Set your git name and email for commits:
    ```
    git config --add user.name "<your name>"
    git config --add user.email "<your email>"
    ```
1. Update your local packages in the root of the git repo:
    ```
    cd scripts
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
1. Run VSCode: `code .`
1. Install the `Lua` v0.21.3 or later and `Lua Helper` v0.1.31 or later extensions in VSCode
1. You may want to change your deployment location so that the deployment function can automatically copy the .conf file to Dual Universe for testing.
    1. In VSCode, hit `CTRL`-`SHIFT`-`P`, and select Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)
    1. Add lines similar to what is in `.vscode/settings.json` for the file locations.  In particular, be sure the installation drive (`e` in this example) is correct:
    ```
    "du.autoconfdir": "/mnt/e/ProgramData/Dual Universe/Game/data/lua/autoconf/custom",
    "du.testconffilename": "ButtonHUD.test.conf"
    ```

Then, when you are ready to create the minified version of the configuration, just do: `CTRL`-`SHIFT`-`B` and select `Wrap and Deploy`.
`ButtonHUD.conf` will be updated with the minified version, and then deployed automatically to your Dual Universe autoconf directory, assuming you have correctly configured it above.

## Creating the wrapped (deployable) `ButtonHUD.conf`

The HUD autoconf is generated from `ButtonHUD.lua`, which is the master implementation.  Note that this is organized
according to how `wrap.lua` expects, which is documented [here](https://board.dualthegame.com/index.php?/topic/20161-lua-tool-script-packagerconfigurator-wraplua/).

The `ButtonHUD.conf` file is generated by `scripts/wrap.sh`, which does the the following:
* Extracts exports and version information
* Runs the lua file through the `luamin` minifier, removing unnecessary whitespace and collapsing symbol names
* Runs that through `scripts/wrap.lua` which creates the DU AutoConf from the script
* Updates the conf file with previously extracted exports and fixes up the L_TEXT localization macros

The above process may be run in one of the following two ways:
* `./wrap.sh true`
* In VSCode: `CTRL`-`SHIFT`-`B` and select `wrap`

The resulting `ButtonHUD.conf` can be deployed to DU using the regular installation instructions.
> NOTE: You should not check in manual edits to `ButtonHUD.conf` as they will be discarded the next time the wrapping scripts are run.
