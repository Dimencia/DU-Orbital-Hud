# How to edit the HUD code

The HUD autoconf is generated from `ButtonHUD.lua`, which is the master implementation.  Note that this is organized
according to how `wrap.lua` expects, which is documented [here](https://board.dualthegame.com/index.php?/topic/20161-lua-tool-script-packagerconfigurator-wraplua/).

The `ButtonHUD.conf` file is generated by `wrap.sh`, which does the the following:
* Extracts exports and version information
* Runs the lua file through the `luamin` minifier, removing unnecessary whitespace and collapsing symbol names
* Runs that through `wrap.lua` which creates the DU AutoConf from the script
* Updates the conf file with previously extracted exports and fixes up the L_TEXT localization macros

The resulting `ButtonHUD.conf` can be deployed to DU using the regular installation instructions.
> NOTE: You should not check in manual edits to `ButtonHUD.conf` as they will be discarded the next time the wrapping scripts are run.
