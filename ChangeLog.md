## ChangeLog - Most recent changes at the top

Version 4.60

- Added AGG support.  Engage AGG > 1000m with ALT-G or Button.  Use alt-c and alt-space to change AGG target height.  NOTE:  turning on brake does not cancel agg for obvious reasons.  You must toggle it off to cancel.
- Updated Save mechanics. Please READ the SAVE section of the README
- Changed emergency warp retry to every second if enabled
- fixed autoroll setting issue
- Brake Toggle or Default mode user variable restored to remember setting
- Testing braking after emergency warp and re-engage of autopilo

Version 4.58
- Change Emergency Warp to retry every 30 seconds if enabled.

Version 4.57
- Glide ReEntry is on a Button now.  Default is off.  If enabled, hitting G will attempt to put you into a glide reentry to ReentryAltitude at ReentrySpeed (2500m and 1050km/hr default, user settable)

Version 4.56
- Damaged components indicated by arrows while in Remote mode.  Allows you to walk around and repair being shown where next one is located.  Toggled on by Button while in remote mode (hold shift to see buttons)
- Removed EmergencyWarp as a user variable. Now toggled by a Button.  Default is off.  If you toggle it on, then when conditions met, EmergencyWarp.  EmergencyWarpRange remains a user variable.
- Removed BrakeToggle as a user variable.  Now toggled by a Button.  Default is Toggle Brakes.  Toggle to enable vanilla Brakes.
- Removed DisplayOrbit as a user variable.  Now toggled by a Button.  Default is on.

Version 4.555
- Fix Cruise text to not be huge.

Version 4.55
- Transponder IFF.  If any radar contacts have a matching transponder tag, they are listed at the top of the screen

Version 4.54
- Emergency Warp support. Set EmergencyWarp to true (default false).  Set EmergencyWarpRange to distance (default 320000 km, farthest default large ship lock range with large radar).  If you have a radar, and a warp engine, and if a target gets within EmergencyWarpRange and all other conditions to warp are met, EmergencyWarp to target will activate.  If it fails to activate, it will not retry.  You can hit ALT-J to stop it within 5 seconds.  NOTE: You can set EmergencyWarp to true and intentionally not put cells in its container and use it as a warning when someone gets within EmergencyWarpRange
- Restored structural integrity (voxel damage).  HUD assumes when you sit down your voxels are at 100% and reports any damage.  Element damage report unchanged.
- Added check for databank before allowing save of locations
- Fixed display of integrity reports.
- Added LastMaxBrake to saved variables to have initial brake value before brakes used if databank used.
- Fixed interplanetary values display when normal planet shown after a local save location.

Version 4.53
- Fixed HUD Color preference not loading from databank properly.

Version 4.52
- Removed structural integrity - too unreliable at this time.  Elemental Intregrity remains.
- Added current acceleration in g's.  Changed gravity reading to g. Currently these are based on 1g earth normal.
- Moved acceleration, gravity, and atmosphere updates to once per second.

Version 4.51 
- Fix for display errors that might have caused control issues.
- Coast Landing will only display if moving at high speed when using gear

Version 4.5 - Autopilot to saved location in atmosphere
- Minified conf file to avoid overflow script limit.  Added a readable version for editing/understanding.
- Initial Pass: Autopilot to a presaved waypoint in atmosphere.  Use: Go to location you wish to mark.  In seat, hold shift and click Save Location.  When wishing to return to a saved point, use ALT-1/2 or SHIFT T/R till you see saved location.  If not on ground, be sure to be pointing in general direction to avoid yaw stall.  Hit Alt-4 to engage.  You may use yaw once brake landing begins to spin in place.  Saved locations may be deleted by selecting it as target and the holding shift and choosing Clear Position.  It is fairly accurate and you should arrive within 15m of marked location assuming good brakes (brake landing).  If you see Coast Landing, be prepared to take over the arrival.  If atmo radar installed, saved location will use nearest target for naming, otherwise will be named #.planet (i.e. 0.Alioth)

Version 4.37
- Fixed damaged display to be visable and color shaded by % damage.

Version 4.36
- Pulled fuel tank fixes
- Pulled mass calculation fixes

Version 4.35
- Initial Warpdrive support.  Warp Widget hidden by default.  Warp Hotkey (default Alt-J) will toggle the widget on if off, off if on, and initiate Warp Jump if conditions met or give message if not.  Widget will autoshow if conditions met to jump.

Version 4.34
- Moved Interplanetary Widget info to slower update (once per second) to save on performance.

Version 4.33
- Fixed throttle arrow to always stay in range for positive and negative throttle.  Throttle color changes to red if in reverse.  Bar removed if in cruise.
- Fixed alt key not to toggle freelook if using alt+# option.  Tapping alt will toggle freelook like normal.

Version 4.32
- Fixed new bug preventing Reentry from occurring

Version 4.31 - Bugfixes and Performance
- On a planet with no atmo, re-rentry will no longer engage if below the designated reentry height (pressing G will enage brake-landing instead)
- Attempt to resolve recent issues - forced garbage collection every second, moved screen drawing to Update instead of on a fixed tick

Version 4.3 - Now with re-entry
- Hitting G while over a planet will attempt to do reentry to a designated altitude hold (default 2500m) at a designated max speed (default 1050km/hr) to avoid re-entry burnup.  ReentrySpeed is user value for speed, ReentryAltitude for height.
- interpret linebreaks for msgText

Version 4.22
- Added MaxPitch as user variable, default value 20 degrees.  Sets max pitch autopilot will use during takeoff and altitude changes while in altitude hold or for re-entry.
- Fixed text display on Orbit panel

Version 4.21 
- Updated non-widget fuel tank display to use slotted tank values (more accurate) for slotted tanks.
- Updated G key to always brake land if gear is up and within capacity of brakes.  Otherwise gear down and manual landing required.

Version 4.2
- Refactored display to more pure CSS for smaller filesize and more efficient frames
- Show Orbit display only if speeds are within max speed and if periapsis and apoapsis exist.
- Modified all automated landings to use brake landing.  This is much safer than the previous autoland, but use under supervision.  Hit G to initiate landing any time.

Version 4.181
- Fixed script error
- Fixed a minor inaccuracy in brake time calculation

Version 4.18
- Added max mass on target planet to Interplanetary info.  Note:  If target planet has atmo, you must be in atmo to get an accurate reading.  The formula is MaxBrakeNewtons / PlanetGravityAtSeaLevel, shown in tons.  So if you are going to a planet with no atmosphere, you must get a reading while in no atmosphere.

Version 4.174
- Added DU version number in lower right hand corner of screen.

Version 4.173
- added displayOrbit user variable for those who do not want the KSP style orbit in upper corner.  Default true (to show)

Version 4.172
- Save autoroll preference when using Brake Landing
- Fix shifting to Cruise Control on autotakeoff.

Version 4.171 
- Added safety check to Brake landing.  If current mass * gravity at sea level > maxBrake power, it will not try an automatic Brake Landing.
- Added user variable for loss of altitude rate, brakeLandingRate, when using brake landing. Default is 30 m/s

Version 4.17 - Brake Landing
- While flying, if you have hover or vertical boosters, and you hit G, your ship will attempt to brake land.  If you are at max load of low altitude lift, or of brakes, do not use.  This does not replace hitting G for autoland while in altitude hold.  To brake land you must cancel altitude hold first.  As with most auto features, toggle brakes to turn off.

Version 4.162
- localized Nav.control.isRemoteControlled() function in unit.start and apTick 
- Only show Follow Mode button if on a Remote.  Alt-8 while on seat will give message only works when on remote.
- Hide autopilot engage button in atmo, give message if use alt-4 in atmo.
- Hide retrograde button if in atmo
- Shift to cruise control once reach takeoff altitude.

Version 4.161
- Updated new values to show n/a if out of gravity.

Version 4.16
- Ship now shows Required forward thrust for current mass at current gravity and Max Mass for max available forward thrust in current gravity.  Note this does not consider lift, just values if you pointed 90deg up.

Version 4.15
- Gyro's autoconnect again.  If you have a gyro on ship and run autoconf after it is placed, this will let you hit alt-9 the gyro will activate.  This can be used to change your controls perceived orientation from Core orientation to Gyro orientation.

Version 4.146
- Must press alt-7 2 times to wipe databank.  A wiped databank prevents saving of flight status variable.
- Attempt to fix calculation of fuelTankOptimization when setting up fuel tanks.

Version 4.145
- Fixed bugs with dimming, more elements are now undimmed when in freelook, dimmed elements are dimmer, artifical horizon is not displayed in freelook
- Fixed fuel display problem with remote control
- Readded brighthud

Version 4.144
- Track trip time and total run time on ship.

Version 4.143
- More optimization refactoring
- Fixed new DU bug with vertical engines firing constantly

Version 4.142
- More optimization refactoring from Chronos.

Version 4.141
- Fix for structural damage showing 99% when no voxels damaged.  Damage report only appears if any damage.

Version 4.14
- Updated damage report to show Structural Integrity (Voxel damage) and Element Integrity (Element damage). Element integrity still shows # of disabled and # of damaged elements.
Max Voxel integrity is set when you sit in the seat and autosaved if you have a databank attached.  To reset it you must perform normal save wipe (ALT-7) per Readme.

Version 4.13
- Added maxBrake to odometer
- Added maxThrust to odometer
- Modified mass to use function call, no need for extraMass anymore.

Version 4.126
- localized unit.getAtmosphereDensity

Version 4.125
- Added to user variables: brightHud = false --export: Enable to prevent hud dimming when in freelook.

Version 4.12
- Optimizations and fix save feature

Version 4.11
- Optimaztions with function localizations

Version 4.1 
- Major change in how html text is formatted, should result in improved performance but report any bugs.

Version 4.065
- Bug fixes.

Version 4.06
- added player variables speedChangeLarge and speedChangeSmall so you can control the rate of throttle change.  Large happens when you tap speed up or down, small happens when you hold speed up or down.
- doors and ramps will not auto open when exiting seat/remote while in space 

Version 4.05 - Odometers, Mass, and Rocket change
- Added a Trip and Lifetime odometer.  Note that trip resets if you get out of seat.  Lifetime doesnt reset unless you clear databank (and only saves with databank)
- Added Total Mass of ship, and a new user parameter extraMass because i cannot calculate honeycomb mass.  set extraMass to honeycomb mass as shown in Builder info
- Modified Rocket Engine performance.  In Cruise Mode it will fire till you reach cruise speed and then again to keep you at that speed till toggled off.  In Travel Mode it will fire continuous till you toggle it back off.

Version 4.04 - Cruise Control with Altitude Hold
- Modified alt-6 to turn on cruise control and altitude hold at same time.  Cruise speed set to current speed, altitude to current altitude.
- Use ALT-C and ALT-SPACE to change set altitude height.
- Hitting G while in altitude hold will start an autolanding like normal, but will also cancel cruise control for you.
-- Reverted 4.05 due to issues with AutoLand caused by fixing vertical engine problems

Version 4.03 More cleanups
- Cleaned  up code
- Removed vertical speed change if altitude is gone (200km)
- Cleaned up time displays and fuel location to account for planet name when in space.

Version 4.02
- Cleaned up comment lines to reduce code size.

Version 4.01
- Fixed time remaining when using multiple tanks.
- Fixed script limit issue where other players couldn't use the seat (and you had to reload it every time you relog)

Version 4.0 - More slots please  
(NOTE: This change means the default vanilla fuel widgets will no longer be shown unless you manually link fuel tanks to control chair/remote)
- Removed automatic slotting of all fuel tanks, freeing up slots for other items. Fuel percentages and time remaining are still shown.  The value for 100% will be the larger of vanilla volume or your current fuel volume when you get in the seat. 
- Added fuelTankOptimization = 0 For accurate fuel levels, set this to the fuel tank optimization level * 0.05 (so level 1 = 0.05, level 5 = 0.25) of the PERSON WHO PLACED the tank. This will be 0 for most people for now.
