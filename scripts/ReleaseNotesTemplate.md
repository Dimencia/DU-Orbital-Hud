## How to Install
1. Scroll down the the **Assets** and click on **`ButtonHUD.conf`**, this should trigger a download for this file.
1. Save the file to *`%ProgramData%\Dual Universe\Game\data\lua\autoconf\custom`*, the filename does not matter (as long as it's still .conf)
1. In-game, right click your seat and go to *Advanced -> Update custom autoconf list*  - If you get a YAML error, you did not follow the above directions corretly.
1. Again, right click your seat and select *Advanced -> Run Custom Autoconfigure -> ButtonsHud - Dimencia and Archaegeo*
1. IMPORTANT: Right click the ship and set the user control scheme to `Keyboard` (*Advanced -> Change Control Scheme -> Keyboard*). This is necessary for the HUD to work, but you can change the actual control scheme in the next step - fear not virtual joystick aces!
1. Right click the seat, choose *Advanced -> Edit LUA Parameters*.  Change the `userControlScheme` to the actual control scheme you wish to use (e.g. `Virtual Joystick`).  You may mouse over the other parameters and set them as you wish - there are many, you should familiarize yourself with them.
1. If you have a Databank installed on your vehicle you may save your parameters using the `Option 7` key (normally mapped to `ALT-7`).  Saved parameters will be restored any time you upgrade the HUD to a new version.

At this point you should be ready to fly!
