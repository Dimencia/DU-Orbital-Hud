## How to Install
1. Scroll down the the **Assets** and click on **`ButtonHUD.conf`**, this should trigger a download for this file.
1. Save the file to %ProgramData%\Dual Universe\Game\data\lua\autoconf\custom (or equivalent directory if you did not do default install), the filename does not matter (as long as it's still .conf)
1. In-game, right click your seat and go to Advanced -> Update custom autoconf list - If you get a YAML error, you did not follow the above directions correctly.
1. Again, right click your seat and select Advanced -> Run Custom Autoconfigure -> ButtonsHud - Dimencia and Archaegeo
1. IMPORTANT: Right click the ship and set the user control scheme to Keyboard (Advanced -> Change Control Scheme -> Keyboard). This is necessary for the HUD to work, but you can change the actual control scheme in the next step - fear not virtual joystick aces!
1. Right click the seat, choose Advanced -> Edit LUA Parameters. Change the userControlScheme to the actual control scheme you wish to use (e.g. Virtual Joystick). You may mouse over the other parameters and set them as you wish - there are many, you should familiarize yourself with them.  You may also change control scheme using a Button while seated.
1. If you have a Databank installed on your vehicle your parameters will save when you stand up. Saved parameters will be restored any time you upgrade the HUD to a new version.  See Saving in the Readme for more information

At this point you should be ready to fly!
